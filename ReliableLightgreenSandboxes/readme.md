Okay so here's the plan as of right now.

We're going to have the carmack formatting for the top
https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive/tree/master/by_day

We're going to have

? questions
! ideas
+ progress
- setbacks
* todos

and notes. notes don't have anything on them.

Each file name is just going to be Xprojectname_plan_yyyymmdd.txt for now

For starters we'll just put everything not in in a linear order

Then we'll format later

At some point it'd be cool to have timestamps to order things differently

Our base unit right now is a line of text. everything is a line of text.

We can also add tags later

for now, we have these as module ideas:
- search
- file i/o
- plan - anything to do with creating a file, etc
- line
- git stuff, becaues it'd be cool if this just auto-logged itself
- formatting tools

alright let's do it.
