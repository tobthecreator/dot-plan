Dot-Plan .plan for June 16, 2023
--------------------------------
* starting with hooking up bash commands to what I already have, everything will go under r for now
+ have basic commands in the router hooked up to 3 args coming in through bash
! would be nice to have a command that lets you all all plans, or plans between a specific set of dates
? do python3 match cases need breaks? it doesn't seem so
* let's work on writing stuff now
* I definitely want to break these bad boys down into small modules at some point just for clarity
- can't quite nail the spacing with */!/?/+/- being tabbed on every line, then notes have a space for readability. settled for notes now just being # and in-line with everything else
* need to add return codes for success from the plan2.py module
